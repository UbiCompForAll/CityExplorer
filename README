Permissions Needed:
-------------------



Steps for compiling the Android app in your debug environment:
--------------------------------------------------------------
Follow the instructions here to make your own debug key:
http://code.google.com/android/add-ons/google-apis/mapkey.html

Replace the key in following line from CityExplorer/res/layout/maplayout.xml
android:apiKey="xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx"
with the key for the machine you compile on

BUGS in Android Development Toolkit (ADT)
-----------------------------------------
When "Graphical Layout" tab is "suddenly" replaced by "Design" (several times per day)
 it always helps deleting the project from the Workspace, and re-importing it from Git
(Don't forget to "commit" and "push" first!)

This then "always" leads to: org.xmlpull.v1.XmlPullParserException: Binary XML file line #5:
 <item> tag requires a 'drawable' attribute or child tag defining a drawable
which can be solved by restarting eclipse

When R.java gets completely out of sync, just run Project -> Clean... every time you think
 you have fixed the problematic res/*.xml files...

BUGS in EGit
============
Resource is out of sync with the file system: '/CityExplorer/.git/refs/remotes/origin/master'.
-Fixed by making a small change, "commit" and "push"

When conflicts are reported, but merge tool unavailable:
See: https://bugs.eclipse.org/bugs/show_bug.cgi?id=354099
Use Shell to:
  git merge origin/master
