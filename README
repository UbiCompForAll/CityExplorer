Steps for compiling the Android app in your debug environment:
--------------------------------------------------------------
Follow the instructions here to make your own debug key:
http://code.google.com/android/add-ons/google-apis/mapkey.html

Replace the key in following line from CityExplorer/res/layout/maplayout.xml
android:apiKey="xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx"
with the key for the machine you compile on

BUGS in Android Development Toolkit (ADT)
-----------------------------------------
When "Graphical Layout" tab is "suddenly" replaced by "Design" (several times per day)
 it always helps deleting the project from the Workspace, and re-importing it from Git
(Don't forget to "commit" and "push" first!)

This then "always" leads to: org.xmlpull.v1.XmlPullParserException: Binary XML file line #5:
 <item> tag requires a 'drawable' attribute or child tag defining a drawable
which can be solved by restarting eclipse
